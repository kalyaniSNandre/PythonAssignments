A newspaper is a publication containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called newsprint. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly.
The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition
from technologies such as radio, television, and the internet. Recent developments on the internet are posing major challenges to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper’s income, is shifting from print to online, resulting in a general decline in newspaper profits. This has led to some predictions that newspapers’ role in society will shrink or even disappear, although historically, 
new media technologies such as radio and television never supplanted print media.
